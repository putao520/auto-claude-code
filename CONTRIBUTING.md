## üìù Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`gofmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and complex logic
- Write tests for new functionality

### Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(wsl): add support for Alpine Linux distribution
fix(path): handle spaces in Windows directory names
docs: update installation instructions
```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Run tests for specific package
go test ./internal/wsl
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for significant features
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

## üìã Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**

6. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to GitHub and create a PR from your fork
